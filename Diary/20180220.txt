Look at dataset and decide what to do.
My project is about predicting whether an amino acid in an alpha helical protein is buried or exposed.  
For parser:
- Make a dictionary where the protein id is the key and the values are a list of two elements (seq, topo). (done, with three sequences)
- Convert the dictionary to a pandas dataframe (done)
- Test parser on whole dataset (done)
- Upload parser to github (done)


For input vector to SVM:
- Read resources 
- Find out what the input vector should be like
