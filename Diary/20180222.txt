Now I have made a key for the maino acid alphabet. the next step is to use this key for my sequences which are in a apndas dataframe. The problem is that i cannot make a string out of the sequences. i tried using a pandas function but couldnt get it to work. Saved it on my home directory as parser_utkast.txt.
