Today I ran grid search testing parameters kernel, gamma and c on SVC. I will now retrain my model using the parameters that gave the best mean test score and then test the new model on my 50 hidden proteins. 
Retrained model and saved as optimized_model.sav.
Predicting on 50 hidden set.
Saving results as opt_pred_50hidden.3line.txt.
Scored prediction with optimized model.

Running five fold cross validation on my pssm training set and testing different window sizes. Window size 11 was the best.
