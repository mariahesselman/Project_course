Today I will focus on organizing my code and making sure that everything works and looks nice! 
To find 50 non redudnant proteins to use to test my model, I did blastclust on my dataset and mildas dataset. 
Now I have a 3 line document with 50 sequences from mildas dataset that are not on my dataset. 
Next step is to predict the topologies for these 50 proteins and see how good the predictions were with MCC, confusion matrix etc. 

I now have a measure of MCC, confusion matrix and other metrics for the prediction my model made on the 50 hidden proteins. I will now go through all my scripts and make them nice and make sure they work!
Things to go through:

1. Parser that takes my dataset and saves an SVM model. (done)
2. Predictor from single sequence (fasta file predictor).(done)
3. Parser that takes my generated pssms and saves an SVM model trained on them. (done)
4. Predictor that can predict the topology of a PSSM. (done). 
6. Script that scores the prediction on 50 hidden proteins. (done)
