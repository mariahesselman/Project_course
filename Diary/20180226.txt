I started again from the beginning.
Why i did this:
i previously parsed my file into a dictionary but when I was going to translate teh sequences into binary I couldnt figure out how to keep the sequences ini the right order.

Therefore, I parsed the file into lists.

Then, I added zeros at the ends of the sequences so that the first and last amino acids are included in the window. 

I MANAGED TO ONE HOT ENCODE MY WINDOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

With X = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
